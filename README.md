### The Process

Due to the fact that I had four days to make this project, I decided to set-up the back-end with all the basic routes for both of my resources. This gave me more time to learn and experiment with React y greater depth than what I actually expected. After add the structure for the front-end and some basic functionality, I decided to go back to the back-end to make my own custom routes to meet my requirements. I spent the last hours before the presentation adding my own touch to the styling and making sure everything worked flawlessly.

##### Stretch Goals:
1. Adding a 'Discover Workouts' route to show workouts created by other people.
2. Adding images and/or avatars.
3. Adding likes to other people workouts.
4. Adding the ability to clone another person workout.

##### Future Iterations
I want to add a timer that will help me rest between sets of every exercise in the workout.
